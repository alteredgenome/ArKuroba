# ArKuroba - imageboard browser for Android  
## We're always on dev here. Please submit issues for any bugs and PRs for any features!
[APK releases](https://github.com/alteredgenome/ArKuroba/releases)

ArKuroba is a fast Android app for browsing imageboards archives, such as yuki.la and 4plebs. It is based upon Adamantcheese's Kuroba which is in turn based on Clover by Floens, but is setup to work with archives.

## Credits
Floens - For the original Clover app
Adamantcheese - For the much improved Kuroba app
K1rakishou - Many features included in Kuroba and thus ArKuroba were possible thanks to them.

## Support
Most of the codebase is identical to Kuroba with the only changes being inclusion of imageboard archives. If an issue comes up, check the Kuroba issues list to see if it is already addressed. If not, issue a request here, however I may just push it forward to Adamantcheese if it is an issue present in the core Kuroba codebase.
